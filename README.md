# Esk8CAD

Open catalog of electric skateboard, DIY, OEM PEV parts — linked CAD files. Aim is to reduce digging through forums and scattered repos of files.

Gatsby frontend + JSON data. Early stage, actively evolving.


website building goal: external database for making a more future proof base for creative and unique ideas (CAD parts also haveing performance reviews from irl ride testing. Info + community feedback and voting system for finding priority for CAD part design improvments)


Categories duplicated for now (data + types) — refactor pending.

Open to contributions.
